well great. the latest version of year in pixels doesn't even have the docx export anymore. so i guess this doesnt work and is *deprecated*

# yip-export

the *Year in Pixels* android app is pretty neat, but it doesn't have a way to export data other than as an image or as a `.docx`, which, come on now

this is an attempt to remedy that

it's a work in progress
